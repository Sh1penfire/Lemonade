# Lemonade
(Put on hold because of (somewhat dumb) projects I already have on)


A unity game for no reason at all, soon moving to Open GL if the game is fun enough

The test of the game game is planned to include

-A Lemon throwing grenades

-Limes to throw things at, because lime juce is bad (person  opinion please don't cancel me on twitter for this)

-Epic boss battle with lightning monster thingy and then giant robot go brr

-3 Generated worlds to explore, which consists of preset tiles with randomness in their contents with large rooms, and a branching choice after the first world which lead into the first boss

-Nonconventional powerups, which act more like tradeoffs. Eg: A speed up boost which makes you more fragile

-Crafting idk why but blowing things up in video games apparently leads to ore dropping which makes no sense hey wait this whole game is nonsensical why do I bother aaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

-A bit more things that I feel like making

-A new toolkit of different powerups and grenades after each boss (there's literaly only two bosses)


most of the core game mechanics should be there, and the loop of the game is usualy as follows

-play for a bit

-die to self damage ot enemy

-learn how zone plays and how enemies attack to deal with them

-git good and go to the boss

-defeat boss and realize you have an option for another, switched up attack

-die using new grenade/item

-repeat steps untill you reach next boss

-repeat cycle

things like shops with currency gained during the run, different kits to start out with and tower defense sections are planned, but not going to be implemented in the test. (Especialy with the AI saying a big "NOPE" earlier on)

Yes, this is a bit less structured game coming from a one inexperianced gamedev. I hope whatever comes out isn't that bad
In all sereousness, thank you if you chose to suport this project in any means. It'll probibly be free to play in it's final version, and maybe I'll try to add multiplayer suport on steam if it releases there but I think Im geting ahead of myself. Expect the initial sprites to be under par compared to my other projects like Endless Rusting and Crystalline Christmas
anyways have fun reading the code lol
